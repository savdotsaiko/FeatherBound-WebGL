# FeatherBound WebGL Build

---

## Play the Game
You can play the latest WebGL build here:  
[https://feathrbound.netlify.app/](https://feathrbound.netlify.app/)

It's hosted on netlify instead of github pages, becase we are using LFS.  
---

## Repository Details
We are using git LFS for this repo.  


> Make sure you have Git LFS installed.

## Known Issues
- **Right-clicking in the WebGL game** may trigger an error.  
  - This issue could not be reproduced in the Unity editor.  
  - We assume this is a browser-specific behavior, not a problem with the game itself.
